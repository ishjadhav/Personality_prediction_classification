# Personality_prediction_classification
MSc Sem 2 project, NMIMS.

##Motivation
The project explores the intersection of personality psychology and machine learning, leveraging the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) dataset. The goal is to predict personality types based on written text, offering insights into decision-making, interactions, and various aspects of individuals' lives. The project contributes to advancements in psychology and artificial intelligence, potentially aiding in personalized interventions, education, and career guidance.

##Abstract
This project presents a machine learning approach for automating the process of predicting personality types based on the MBTI personality type indicator. 
The paper uses Neuro language programming and XGBoost, an optimized distributed Gradient Boosting library, to develop the machine learning model. 
The accuracy of the XGBoost model is compared to other existing methods, and the results show that the presented methodology has better accuracy and reliability. 
The paper concludes that the developed methodology can effectively assist NLP practitioners and psychologists in identifying personality types and associated cognitive processes.
