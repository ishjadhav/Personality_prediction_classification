# Personality_prediction_classification
MSc Sem 2 project, NMIMS.

## Motivation <br/>
The project explores the intersection of personality psychology and machine learning, leveraging the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) dataset. 
The goal is to predict personality types based on written text, offering insights into decision-making, interactions, and various aspects of individuals' lives. 
The project contributes to advancements in psychology and artificial intelligence, potentially aiding in personalized interventions, education, and career guidance.

## Abstract <br/>
This project presents a machine learning approach for automating the process of predicting personality types based on the MBTI personality type indicator. 
The paper uses Neuro language programming and XGBoost, an optimized distributed Gradient Boosting library, to develop the machine learning model. 
The accuracy of the XGBoost model is compared to other existing methods, and the results show that the presented methodology has better accuracy and reliability. 
The paper concludes that the developed methodology can effectively assist NLP practitioners and psychologists in identifying personality types and associated cognitive processes.

## Introduction <br/>
Personality psychology studies individual differences and their impact on behavior, thoughts, and emotions. The project predicts personality types from text using machine learning on the MBTI dataset. Various steps include data preparation, feature extraction, and model building. Machine learning algorithms such as CatBoost, XGBoost, and decision trees are used to predict personality types.

## Objective <br/>
Develop a machine learning model for accurate personality prediction.
Compare the performance of different machine learning algorithms.
Evaluate the impact of pre-processing techniques on model performance.
Model Evaluation
The CatBoost Classifier, with an accuracy of 0.672622, outperformed other models, making it the chosen model for personality prediction.

## Prediction using CatBoost model <br/>
A sample input resulted in the prediction of "ENTP" personality, with traits like innovation, curiosity, logical thinking, and suitability for roles such as Entrepreneur or Data Scientist.

## Conclusion <br/>
The project successfully employs machine learning to predict personality types, with the CatBoost model showing high accuracy. The insights gained can be applied in education, psychology, and human resource management.
